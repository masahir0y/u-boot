PINCTRL (PIN CONTROL) subsystem
This document outlines the pin control subsystem in U-Boot

Design Policy
=============

- Deal with the same device tree interface as pinctrl drivers in Linux have.

  Device Tree is a hardware description language, which is not specific to a
  certain software project.  It allows us to import device trees from other
  projects (mostly Linux) as long as we follow their bindings specification.

- Achieve small memory footprint
